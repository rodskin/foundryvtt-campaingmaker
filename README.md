# default compendiums
Creating a blank module with compendiums
Actual compendiums:
- Equipment
- Items
- Spells
- Weapons
- Players
- NPCs
- Monsters
- Journals
- Playlists
- Scenes

# TODO
- There are other parameters you could add support for like "languages" and  the "lang" folder. If this is just for compendiums though, those may not be useful.
